# Speechifier
A little text generator, currently being run on Donald Trump speeches and quotations, just for fun :)
Included the text we're using for seed material and also the code to generate from it. 
It's a bit messy now because we went from lists to dictionaries to allow for more weighted generation, but we'll clean that up shortly.
Try it on any corpus you want! It's pretty dumb, so it makes a lot of nonsense sentences, but it's a good time and every now and again, it comes up with a real gem.
